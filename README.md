Playing with maps:   
- [US election results](US_elections) at the county level, including cartograms, that is, maps based on population and not on land area. Resulting figures look like the following:

- [kronomaps](kronomaps): computing travel times from given location using the Google Maps API, generate isochrones (fixed time contours), and create maps where the radial distance from starting point is given by travel time instead.
