Democratic state lawmaker, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/us/politics/poliquin-maine-loses.html\">defeated New England’s lone House Republican</a>, Bruce Poliquin after the incumbent failed to win a majority of the vote and the state’s new ranked-choice voting system came into play. Mr. Golden received the majority of votes in the second round of vote tabulation, according to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MESecOfState/status/1063124283680014338\">Maine Secretary of State’s office</a>.\n\nMaine is the first state in the nation to begin using ranked-choice voting: Instead of selecting just one candidate in a race, voters rank them in order of their preference, and those rankings are used to decide the contest if no candidate receives a majority at the outset. Look to the Second District, which covers the vast, sparsely populated majority of the state’s land area, as a barometer of how the state’s famously independent-minded voters are feeling about the state of the country. The district that gave President Trump his only electoral vote from New England in 2016.","seat":2,"seat_name":"District

more endangered than this one. The incumbent, Rick Nolan, barely won in 2016 and is not seeking another term. The expansive district, which stretches from the Minneapolis exurbs through the mining towns of the Iron Range, is heavily unionized, and for decades it was solidly Democratic territory. But President Trump is very popular — he carried the district by 16 percentage points — and his trade policies have lifted the region’s iron mines.\n\nPete Stauber, a county commissioner and former Duluth police lieutenant, is the Trump-endorsed Republican candidate.

Mr. Rossi is a familiar name in Washington state politics, having run for governor twice and the United States Senate once.
